Below are some study tips and links. I trued to focus on resources that are helpful for all my courses, i.e.  subject independent. If you find a resource that is helpful, please let me know so that I can add it!

*   Scientifically proven study strategies from [The Learning Scientists](http://www.learningscientists.org/videos). There is one overview video to watch at the top, and more detailed on each of the 6 strategies below that. I also suggest you click through the entries on their blog.
*   [CrashCourse Biology](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3EED4C1D684D3ADF) videos on YouTube

What's the best way to study?
-----------------------------

Everybody learns differently and you need to learn how to study your way. When asked, my collegue Dr. Jackson says: "Some people highlight the text book. Some take notes on their computer. Some like flashcards. When I was in college I took a lot of notes. Then I would copy my notes into another notebook, but only the stuff I didn't know. I'd study that stuff, then copy over the stuff I didn't know into a third notebook. Repeat. Repeat. Once I had about a half a page of stuff I didn't know, I'd just cram that in my head right before the exam. It worked pretty well, but not always."

_The method itself doesn't really matter_, but there are some strategies links to an external site that have been supported by scientific research to improve learning and understanding.
