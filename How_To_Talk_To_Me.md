Talking to me in the classroom is easy - just come upfront after the lecture. But how do you best get a hold of me outside of class? Email. Don't leave phone messages - I am really bad with those, but I answer student emails on weekdays within 24-48 hours. I have multiple courses, many other obligations, and literally hundreds of students (and a very bad memory for names). It is essential that each email has a clear subject line that identifies the course and topic being addressed (bad example: “Hi”; good example: “BIOL499 Question about word limit for squamous cells in jellyfish assignment”). If you ask anything related to grades, attendance, etc. you email has to come from your Longwood or CANVAS account (that's not my preference, but required by [FERPA](https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/audience/parents-and-students "Link")). Unlike in high school, FERPA also doesn't allow me to talk with your parents about school related stuff (that, actually, also is my preference). C'mon, you are wearing big-boy/girl pants now.

Again, craft your emails carefully in a professional style, with proper salutation, punctuation, grammar, spelling, and syntax. This is good practice for writing formal letters in professional communication - a skill that is *even more* important for your future career than knowing where the hamate bone is located!

Curious when you'll get feedback on that assignments or exam? I typically don't forget to grade those... If I haven't posted the results within an hour, it's most likely because I also have exams from a different class to grade, 20 students waiting to be advised, three faculty meetings, and need to prepared labs and lectures... It would, however, be very unusual if it takes longer than 1-2 weeks after the posted due date.

Questions about your grade? Please email. The **CANVAS grade-book** is in my professional opinion confusing and inadequate, often giving you an inaccurate picture. This is why I typically **disable** it.
