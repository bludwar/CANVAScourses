# About this course

In this course you will learn about invertebrates. Invertebrates include a wide range of animals such as insects, arachnids, mollusks, crustaceans, worms, jellyfish, and many others. They are incredibly diverse and make up the vast majority of animal species on Earth - by some estimates 97% of all animals! They are found in nearly every environment, from deep oceans to high mountains, and they play essential roles in ecosystems, such as pollination, decomposition, and as a part of the food web.

### Invertebrate Biology

This course is designed to be a survey of the most prominent branches of the phylogenetic tree. Working from the protozoans to the chordates, this course explores evolution, systematics, physiology, morphology, life history, ecology and behavior of select species. This phylogenetic context will provide a unique opportunity to understand the problems common to all life and how evolution has solved them. Labs will include studying the body plans of major phylogenetic groups to understand how structure and function are interlinked. Course coverage includes many groups important to medicine (e.g. many parasitic organisms) as well as to other disciplines such as geology, ecology, paleontology and neuroscience.



What you will need for this course:
-----------------------------------------

1. A copy of the textbook "**An introduction to the Invertebrates**" by **Janet Moore**, 2nd edition, Cambridge University Press, 2006, ISBN 978-0-521-67406-5. This is different from the text books I have used in previous years, but I believe it is worth the change. This book is not only cheaper, but also significantly better for our purposes.

2. **optional:** If you want an excuse to buy art supplies, here it is: We will make drawings in every lab. I am a strong believer that drawings - unlike photos - help you observe and see the details that would otherwise miss. I'll supply you with basic supplies - pencils and paper. If you do, however, want to bring your own supplies (a proper sketch pad, pencils, maybe colored pencils, eraser, sharpener, etc.) you are more than welcome.

   I, personally, like Graphite Sketch Pencil sets like this [Faber-Castell Graphite Sketch Pencil Set](https://www.amazon.com/Faber-Castell-Creative-Studio-Graphite/dp/B00OQJYNW2/ref=sr_1_6?crid=170CNVROS7KHU&keywords=pencil%2Bset&qid=1704304491&sprefix=pencil%2Bset%2Caps%2C102&sr=8-6&th=1}), or these [STAEDTLER Mars Lumograph Art Drawing Pencils](https://www.amazon.com/STAEDTLER-break-resistant-super-bonded-100-G12/dp/B0014E2S0Q/ref=sr_1_10?crid=170CNVROS7KHU&keywords=pencil%2Bset&qid=1704304491&sprefix=pencil%2Bset%2Caps%2C102&sr=8-10&th=1). I also buy tons of these (cheap) [Sketchpads 9X12" Inch (68lb/100g)](https://www.amazon.com/Bachmore-Sketchpad-Amateurs-Charcoal-Sketching/dp/B07RG97YN6?th=1) for my kids. For color - which is generally really not necessary - these [Prismacolor Scholar Colored Pencils, 60 Pack](https://www.amazon.com/Prismacolor-Scholar-Colored-Pencils-assortment/dp/B004GIIZCW/ref=sr_1_2?crid=251IRGRC0RKBM&keywords=Prismacolor%2BScholar%2BColored%2BPencils%2C%2B60%2BPack&qid=1704305098&sprefix=prismacolor%2Bscholar%2Bcolored%2Bpencils%2C%2B60%2Bpack%2Caps%2C222&sr=8-2&th=1) are a really good value. This is also an opportunity to use your new art marker set, though I have to admit that I have so far not mastered their use myself. As stated before: I'll supply you with basic pencils and copy paper if you don't want to purchase your own supplies.

CANVAS navigation
-----------------

While you are probably familiar with CANVAS, here are the basics of where to find what when looking at the navigation bar on the left:

*   Announcements: Here you will find the latest news and important announcements. Please check your email and the course announcements frequently, i.e. at least once each weekday.

*   Modules: Brings you to the list of modules that we will work through over the course of the semester. I organize my courses by having a new module for each week, e.g. we'll work on the 3rd module in week 3 of the semester. Each module contains all the links to lecture files, assignments, exams, etc. for that week.

*   Assignments: While assignments are linked in the modules, it's sometimes easier to just click here and see what assignments (most of which are graded) are due and when, or to submit your work.

*   Syllabus: The syllabus spells out all course policies, but it also contains a lot of useful information regarding where to find additional help or resources. If you have any question regarding this course, the syllabus is a great first place to look.

*   Textbook: This is a link to the free OpenStax text book we are using

*   Visible Body Courseware: This is a link to the website we use for lab exercises. You can also go directly to [Visible Body](http://courseware.visiblebody.com/).

*   Student Course Evaluation: You will have the opportunity to provide course feedback through this link.

*   CANVAS grade-book: The **CANVAS grade-book** is in my professional opinion confusing and inadequate, often giving you an inaccurate picture. This is why I typically **disable** it. I'll post available grades by L-number in the first module and you can always email me for an up-to-date grade estimate.
