Etiquette expectations
----------------------

Electronic communication is quick and efficient, but unfortunately also bears a much greater risk to be rude or offend somebody (hopefully unintentionally) than a carefully crafted snail mail letter. I cannot stress this enough: take enough time when crafting a response to make sure it's professional, polite, well thought through, and reaches the intended recipients. In your professional career an emotional quick fired email or post can cost you your job or at the very least hamper your career. I have seen it over and over again... don't let it happen to you. Take your time to compose your communications. Spell check them. If it's important, let it sit overnight and send/post it the next morning after taking a second look. What you wrote in rage the night before might just seem inappropriate the next morning.

Prerequisite knowledge and minimal technical skills
---------------------------------------------------

Every instructor has to assume some common knowledge and skills among his students. That includes whatever you were supposed to learn in the courses that are prerequisites to this course. Skills, such as some level of professional writing and researching information on the internet (Google Scholar, Wikipedia, YouTube), or in the library (e.g. ordering papers via Inter-Library-Loan). In terms of technology, I assume that you have a laptop and know the basic use of MS Office 360 or Google Docs and Sheets, as well as a web browser like Chrome, Safari, or Edge.

About Me

Dr. Bjoern Ludwar (pre-pandemic, with relatively short black hair) (ludwarbc@longwood.edu)  

After three semesters studying Electrical Engineering, I switched majors. I realized that Engineering is simply too dry for me. I also couldn't deal with a 300:3 male to female student ratio. After some time in the military (Germany's elite 1st Mountain Division), I got a BSc and MS in Zoology - with minors in Paleontology, Genetics, and Biomedical Engineering - at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (established 1742) in Germany and the University of Kansas in Lawrence, KS. Next, I pursued a Ph.D. in Neurobiology at the University Cologne (established 1388) in Germany, studying the neural control of locomotion in walking sticks, and spend some time at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) in Woodshole, MA.

The start of a 11 year career in basic neuroscience research (to find out more search my name in [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Ludwar+B)) was my first job as postdoc at Ohio University. I used _Information Theory_ to describe nerve impulse transmission along axons. I then took a PostDoc position at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in NYC, where I used electrophysiology and calcium imaging techniques to study neuronal networks that generate and control movements. Eventually, I joined the faculty at Mt. Sinai as a Research Assistant Professor and started teaching A&P labs, a class on microscopy and imaging, and a part of a neuroscience class (all for MD or MD/PhD students).

In 2014, I joined Longwood and mostly exchanged my lab coat with the lectern to share the wonderful world of science with as many students as I can. There isn't much Neurobiology at Longwood, but if you look closely at what I am teaching, you'll notice a pattern. A lot of Anatomy and physiology, as I am an animal physiologist and anatomy is easy! (I also sneak a lot of neuro into BIOL207 and BIOL301 ;-) And then everything invertebrate (incl. insects), because I have worked with invertebrates for decades as my laboratory animals and learned a whole lot about them.
