CANVAS navigation
-----------------

While you are probably familiar with CANVAS, here are the basics of where to find what when looking at the navigation bar on the left:

*   Announcements: Here you will find the latest news and important announcements. Please check your email and the course announcements frequently, i.e. at least once each weekday.

*   Modules: Brings you to the list of modules that we will work through over the course of the semester. I organize my courses by having a new module for each week, e.g. we'll work on the 3rd module in week 3 of the semester. Each module contains all the links to lecture files, assignments, exams, etc. for that week.

*   Assignments: While assignments are linked in the modules, it's sometimes easier to just click here and see what assignments (most of which are graded) are due and when, or to submit your work.

*   Syllabus: The syllabus spells out all course policies, but it also contains a lot of useful information regarding where to find additional help or resources. If you have any question regarding this course, the syllabus is a great first place to look.

*   Student Course Evaluation: You will have the opportunity to provide course feedback through this link.

*   CANVAS grade-book: The **CANVAS grade-book** is in my professional opinion confusing and inadequate, often giving you an inaccurate picture. I'd love to disable it and post the grades in another way, but they won't let me.

* For BIOL301: Access to Pearson's Mastering A&P is integrated through a link in Modules (2nd link from the bottom in Start Here!). You have to use this link to synchronize your Mastering account with the course. This link also gives you **access to the eBook textbook**!
