Here at Longwood, like most Universities, we have a language that might be unfamiliar to you. And you, as an independent adult, are expected to know specific dates and terminology, to select your own classes, to plan your academic schedule strategically months and years in advance, and to know where to find resources you need for help.

Some of the information (and more!) can be found in detail in the [Longwood Student Handbook](http://www.longwood.edu/studenthandbook/) and the [Catalog](http://catalog.longwood.edu/). The **Catalog** describes which courses you must take to meet your major and minor requirements and get your degree. It may change in small ways each year, but you are only bound to the rules in the Catalog you start with. You can check Degreeworks to see which Catalog year applies to you. The **Handbook** describes almost everything else about your time at Longwood. The Handbook may change each year, and you are bound to any such rule changes.

Go the the catalog and find your major. Skim through it. Go to the handbook and read it. All of it.

Your professors and advisors
============================

What do I call them?
--------------------

It depends on the person. If they have a Ph.D., or other doctorate degree, then call them "doctor so-and-so" (that's with their last name, of course). If they don't have a doctorate degree, then "professor so-and-so". Some instructors may offer for you to call them by their first name. As for me, any of them will work. Dr. Ludwar, Professor Ludwar, or just plain Ludwar (as long you can say it with a respectfully, loving intonation).

How do I get help from a professor?
-----------------------------------

Two words: Office Hours! All Longwood professors are required to offer four hours per week of open-door office hours. No appointment is necessary. Normally, I'd say "Just show up", but as there sometimes is a line, I recommend to email and reserve a 30 minute time slot. The open door office hours are posted on your course syllabus and outside the professor's office door. If you don't know where their office is, look at the syllabus, look on Longwood's website, ask an older student, or ask another professor.

The best use of office hours is to get help with specific questions you have. Did you not understand something from class? Office hours. Did you struggle with the reading? Go to office hours. Have a question about a writing assignment? Office hours. Struggling with a personal or family emergency and need to figure out how to stay up to date with the class? Yep, office hours.

Going to office hours is also a very important way that you get to know your professors, and that they get to know you.

What if I can't make it to office hours?
----------------------------------------

That's when email is your best bet. Write a clear, professional quality email, with specific concerns or questions, and send it from your Longwood email address. Give your professor at least one day to respond, and don't expect a response over the weekend. However, many of us will send a quick reply whenever we can.

Course planning and scheduling
------------------------------

Anything regarding your courses, credit numbers, majors, minors, and transcripts, is managed by the [Registrar](https://www.longwood.edu/registrar/). Their website has some good suggestions and links to official rules and forms. You will have to deal with them directly if you want to withdraw from a class, add or change a major, transfer credits, and for other milestones later in your Longwood career.

You can see some of the Registrar-related info, like your degree requirements, by accessing [DegreeWorks](http://blogs.longwood.edu/degreeworks/).

Academic Advisors
-----------------

When you have questions, or need to make a plan, this is where your academic advisor comes in. Your advisor is a professor in the department of your major, but who may not be the instructor for any of your courses. While your advisor is employed by the university, his or her goal is to make sure you get the best education for your money. Professors are (so far) independent from the administration and do _not_ consider the university's economic benefits when advising you. In other words, they are in your corner. You can find out who your advisor is on DegreeWorks, and find their email and office on the department web page. Then go introduce yourself during their office hours.

You will work with your advisor to build a class plan for your time at Longwood that will 1) let you graduate on time, and 2) prepare you for whatever it is you want to do after Longwood.

A little after the semester mid-point, we will begin academic advising so that you can register for the classes for the next semester. Your advisor may have you sign up for a time on a sheet outside their door, come to office hours, or they may use an online appointment scheduler (like me). You should get an email from them inviting you to sign up for an appointment, or inviting you to come to their office. **But don't go empty handed**:

1.  Go to [my.longwood.edu](my.longwood.edu) and find the course schedule for the next semester.
2.  Find the classes you think your are supposed to take (look on Degreeworks and in the course catalog, and you may have gotten a sample 4-year course plan for your major).
3.  Put together a specific schedule without time-conflicts for the next semester.
4.  Repeat at least twice so that you have multiple schedules in case one of your first choice classes is filled before you get to register.
5.  Bring those schedules to your appointment with your advisor.

If you are just starting at Longwood, you probably will need a PIN to register. You can only get this PIN from your advisor. **You will not be able to register for classes without meeting with your advisor!**

Credit numbers, Important calendar dates, and what they mean
------------------------------------------------------------

Longwood students are required to be enrolled for at least 12 credits to be considered a full-time student. Being full time let's you get financial aid, and live in the dorms, among other things.

You will need to take 14-15 credits per semester, on average, and get sufficient grades in those credits, to finish in four years. You may have to take 17-18 credits some semesters, and 12 credits during others.

Getting a passing grade (D- or higher) lets those credits apply to your degree and your GPA. **HOWEVER** (this is a big "however"), most classes that are specifically required for your major require a C- or C for you to continue.

Your GPA must stay above certain levels to avoid [academic probation and suspension](http://www.longwood.edu/registrar/policies--regulations/), and to graduate.

What is the difference between Add/drop and withdrawing?
--------------------------------------------------------

The add/drop period (ends at 5 pm of the 6th day of classes each semester) let's you change courses early in the semester without any grade or financial consequences. Maybe a seat in a lab section that works better with your schedule opened up, or you realize that you're a morning person and would rather take the 8 a.m. lecture. You can make those changes yourself during that period on [my.longwood.edu](my.longwood.edu). The classes you drop will not show up on your transcript. Just don't drop below 12 credits total, and check with your advisor!

[Withdrawing](http://www.longwood.edu/registrar/policies--regulations/#withdrawal) ends much later in the semester. If you withdraw from a class, a "W" will be entered on your transcript. That "W" will not affect your GPA. Well, that's not always true... it won't affect your **Longwood GPA**, however, some programs (think medical schools) calculate their own GPA from your transcript and will include a "W" in their calculation! You will not get credit for the course. However you will be responsible for the tuition, there may be financial aid consequences, and you will have to retake the course if it is required for your major. And if the withdrawal drops you below 12 credits, you will no longer be a full time student!

What if my grade in my class is failing, or lower than needed?
--------------------------------------------------------------

First, go to office hours. Go as early in the semester as possible, **before things get too bad**. Talk to your professor about how to improve, and make sure the grade you think you have represents the grade you will get. You should be able to get an official or unofficial grade estimate from your professors.

First year students (and some others) should get grade estimates midway through the semester. In some courses, those official estimates are a good estimate of the grade you will get at the end of the semester if you continue your current level of work. In other classes, the estimate may mean something else. How do figure out which it is? Go to office hours and ask!

If you confirm that you will probably get an insufficient grade, you have a few options:

*   You can withdraw from the course if the withdraw deadline hasn't passed and you will still have 12 credits after withdrawing.
*   You can try to stick it out, possibly get the low grade, and retake the class the next semester. If you do this, don't just give up and disappear!. You will probably have to retake the class, maybe with the same professor, so you might as well try to learn as much as possible to make the second time that much easier. When you retake the class, your new grade will replace the old grade in your Longwood GPA calculation, so it's important to learn as much as possible! Also, your financial aid may depend on you attending all of your classes for the semester.

Being the best student you can be
---------------------------------

Every class is different. Every professor has different expectations and even rules. What works everywhere, every time?

Read the syllabus. Read the syllabus. Read the syllabus.
--------------------------------------------------------

I'm serious. Professors joke on social media about the questions they get from students that are already answered in the syllabus. If you have a question about how the class works, read the syllabus before asking the professor. Use it find out things like:

*   Contact info, office location, and office hours for your professor.
*   The course schedule, especially exam dates. Get those in your calendar ASAP! Some of the schedule may change during the semester (like lecture topics), but the exam dates will probably not change!
*   Due dates for major assignments.
*   Class attendance policies.
*   Late assignment policies.
*   Other specific course policies, like what the instructor considers a violation of the Honor Code, whether you should or must not bring your book/laptop/phone to class, among others.

Read assignments before they are due.
-------------------------------------

Whether in the syllabus or on a course webpage, you will be given a list of things to read with dates. Read the assigned material **BEFORE** that date.

Read all assigned materials at least three times
------------------------------------------------

Yep. Three times. At least. College is a lot of reading.

I tell my students to do the following as a bare minimum:

1.  Read once through before the due date. You may not get much out of that first reading, and that's ok. Don't highlight, don't try to take notes, just read. Get the gist. Maybe try to learn some of the vocabulary. Find the major concepts. But don't try to get too much out of the first reading. Just do enough to understand what is happening in that class. If you have a reading assignment, do it after that first reading, and go back to the reading to help you.
2.  After the class that covers that material, read it again. This might be right after lecture, or after lunch, or that night. While class is still in your head, do the reading again. Add to your class notes. Make flashcards. Go over questions. Try to figure out what you still don't understand. Then go to office hours if you still have questions.
3.  Wait a while (depending on when the next exam is), but read it again. Maybe one day later, or one week later.

Use a calendar!
---------------

You will have a lot of due dates, meetings, and classes. Put everything in there. I prefer to use my phone's calendar because in syncs to all of my computers and I always have it on me. I tend to lose paper, but a good paper calendar may work better for you.

Do a weekly review
------------------

Pick a day of the week where you can sit and do the work of work, but don't have to do work. For me, this is Friday morning since I don't usually have deadlines on Fridays. Review yourself:

1.  Go through your emails and Canvas announcements to make sure you didn't miss anything important in the past week. Add anything new to your calendar that you need to.
2.  Open your calendar. Look through the past week. Make sure you did everything you needed to, and think about if there is anything you need to follow up on.
3.  Look through the next two weeks of your calendar. If you already put all your deadlines in it, this will remind you of deadlines so there aren't any surprises. If you have an upcoming deadline for a major project, get to work!

Try to have a "growth mindset"
------------------------------

If you knew everything you needed to know already, you wouldn't be in school. Not even us professors know everything, and we still have a lot of learning to do about something. If you received a failing grade on an assignment, you are not a failure, but your work on that assignment may have been. You have some growing to do. Again, we all do.

Find out what mistakes you made. Find out how to improve. Try different ways of studying, or reading, or preparing for exams. Be tough. Try to develop your inner grit.

Put in the time
---------------

Longwood policy suggests students spend two hours outside of class on course work for every one hour in class per week. That work includes reading, writing, watching videos, studying, and working on assignments. Most classes are three hours-per-week lectures, so that's six hours a week outside of class. If you have a two hour lab for that class, you should spend an additional one hour per week outside of class. That means that for a typical four-credit science course with lab, you will spend five hours in class, and seven hours outside of class, on that class per week.

Let's say you have two science classes with labs, and two Civitae classes without labs (for 14 credits total). That's a total of 16 hours per week in class, and 26 hours (7 + 7 + 6 + 6) per week outside of class, just on classwork. That's 42 hours per week total on classwork. That's a 9-to-5 job, five days a week, a real full-time job!

Your social events, real job, and extra-curricular activities have to work around that other full time job. There is no way to be successful without putting in that time every single week.

Take care of yourself
---------------------

That's a lot of hours! It takes a toll on your brain and body, so take care of yourself. College is a road-trip, your body is the car, your brain is your engine. You must give it fuel, air, a rest, and even take it to the car wash every once in a while.

1.  **Sleep.** 8 or more hours every night if you can. Many studies have found that pulling an all nighter to study for an exam leads to worse grades than just going to bed and relying on what you already know! Being well rested and focussed in class, even at 8 am, will mean you get more out of the class, which will save you studying time later. Deep sleep actually lets your brain flush waste from around the cells!
2.  **Eat.** Feed your brain and body. Eat well-balanced meals, but don't be afraid to treat yourself after a long study session.
3.  **Move.** Get some exercise. That may be a walk around the building or a marathon. It turns out that vigorous exercise is good for the brain! It reduces stress and helps the body deliver fuel and oxygen to the brain.
4.  **Rest.** Don't always work on class work. Do something fun. Something that gives you a break from thinking about class work. That may be exercising, playing video games, cooking, or just spending time with family and friends. College is demanding, but don't let yourself get burned out.
5.  **Time.** Everything, especially learning, takes time. Studies show that the longer the time between reviewing the same material, the better a student learns it. Don't expect to learn everything right away. Have patience with yourself, and give yourself the time it takes to grow.
6.
